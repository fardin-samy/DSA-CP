--> For a particular element in the array A(i) the contribution of A(i) in all subarrays is multiplication of left
    and right elements of A(i) including A(i).
For example A = [1,3,6,2,8,5] , in this array the contribution of 6 in all subarrays is
=  (left elements including 6) * (right elements including 6)
= 3 * 4  
= 12
